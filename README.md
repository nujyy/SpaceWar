This game is written in C# with a user interface built using Windows Forms.
The code includes the creation of classes such as Bullet, Collision Detector, Form1, and GameOyun. 
It controls the movement direction of bullets, collision detection, and the movement and behavior of enemies. 
Each enemy has its own unique movement behavior, providing a more dynamic and challenging gameplay experience.
   Developing this game has been a highly enjoyable learning process, and I've gained a lot of experience with C# programming. 
   I hope this project will be useful to you as well.
